# Prompt Library
Using LLMs to generate code and features for your customers can boost your productivity. When exploring how LLMs respond, it is apparent that you get better results when your prompts include a range of business and technology principles/tenets, along with the needs of different contributing roles from both internal positions (architect, security, risk) and customer roles.

## Structure
Prompts are organized into segments to balance the need for context against the overall prompt size and token requirements. We trade off multiple iterations with varying context to achieve high quality outputs. For example, initial prompts for code may start with role definitions for enterprise architecture, then iterate with engineer, security, designer, and customer-relevant roles. 

The Features and Product directories are expected to store features and process materials over time that explain the thought and development process. They will add additional relevance to LLMs over time as your team develops additional capabilities for customers.
