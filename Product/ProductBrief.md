#Product Brief
#This document should provide enough context to the LLM or to human consumers to guide development of an entire product or large feature.
#When to use: Use this template when creating a feature that you expect is complex enough to require multiple days of work,
#or has communications overhead integrating LLMs and humans together on the same project. Also use this when working with multiple LLMs
#on a single project. It should function as a guidepost for product development. It's usually not necessary to provide this level of detail
#when working on a small feature enhancement to an existing product. If you are, for example, changing the color of a button for a test,
#you probably don't need to write a product brief - but just execute your normal test planning

#Team
#Use this section to articulate the team of people or LLMs who will work on this product. It's helpful both to you and to future human or
#LLM consumers to understand the roles and capabilities of the team. For example, we frequently use a planning agent that may take this entire
#product brief as a prompt. The planning agent needs to know that coding agents, security review agents, marketing image generation agents,
#designers, engineers, etc are available to work on the project. That will help shape the rest of the plan because the capabilities will be known.

#Executive Summary
#Use this section to provide a high level summary of the product or large feature. This is perhaps the most useful section of the document to many
#LLM agents as it provides basis for other material.

#Business Goals/Key Benefit
#List specific business impact that will be realized by this brief
#What do we expect this product to achieve. We should have a view / opinion on how this feature or product will move the business forward.
#ideally align this with your business operating plan.

#Background and Overview
#Use this section to provide specific backgroun for consumers of this document. For example, an LLM may need detailed background on your
#customers and their problems that you would not typically provide to engineers or others on your team because you have onboarded those people
#onto your customers and business problems. This section is how you onboard the LLM. Do not assume that the LLM understands anything about your
#specific business - if it had this context, then why are you in business! It is of course valid to use LLMs to help create and distill knowledge
#that will be supplied in this section.

#Scope and High Level Requirements [detailed use cases and constraints]
#use this section just like a classic PRD to explain what use cases and constraints you envision being solved by this product.

#Out of Scope
#One of our core principles is to execute on reasonably sized chunks of work that provide value to our customers. We can't therefore
#have a product brief that says "Launch Tacos to the Moon" and expect that we build a rocket, make tacos, build a landing base, and ship them.
#our work in this brief must be achievable, and the LLMs, as of early 2025, perform very poorly without explict constrainst on their work.
#this is your oppportunity to help explicitly define the boundaries.

#Risks of Not doing Project
#This is a contributor to investment decisions - if we don't do this what happens or what might happen. Do your best to quantify the risk.

#Success Criteria and Metrics
#[Specific KPIs and KEIs - each one must be measurable, if not measurable, then include the required work to measure]
#This should tie into the business plan and any other ways that you have to measure customer success/satisfaction.

#Dependencies
#What other projects or other parts of the plan need to be completed in order for this product brief to be realized? You may find yourself
#working with multiple LLM coding agents and expect that each one

#Requested ETA
#When should this happen? We should always avoid asking an LLM to provide a timeline. I've yet to see one that has enough context to prepare
#anything approaching an accurate timeline for all but the most simple projects (achieveable in a few hours or less). You as the leader need
#to understand your resource picture and timeline.

#Deployment Plan
#How is this going to be rolled out? Are we going to simply push it? Do a progressive rollout? Test? If so, what tests are planned?

#Measurement and Feedback Loop
#How will we provide

#GTM
